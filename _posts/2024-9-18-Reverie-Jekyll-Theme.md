excerpt: Getting setup with the Reverie Jekyll theme.

For my first post, I am taking inspiration from Yu Dong's [DongDataDive](https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/) posts and articles on setting up GitHub Pages and using a Jekyll theme.
Finding very little support for the Reverie theme, hopefully this can answer some questions for others on the same path :)

After creating a Repository (some starting tips in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@kapil0123/building-your-stunning-github-portfolio-a-step-by-step-guide-a5e8650c5009) steps one and two). Next, I searched for [free Jekyll themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/free) and selected [Reverie](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/reverie).

There are many ways to upload the theme to your github pages, but I'll outline a couple below. 

Option 1) 
You can open the template in a code space

Option 2) 
You can more easily Go to the Live Demo Button, and navigate to the Getting Started page.

From there, you'll find a link to "Use this Template", and you can type in "github.io"

This will take you to 

## _config.yml file changes

I'll admit, I called in some help on this one. My limited experience with Git meant I couldn't figure out if I was stuck on something in Github or in the Jekyll files.


You'll also want to update the title, author, etc.

### adding images in the icon

## editing _layouts for Navigation Menu

## adding new _pages and removing pre-built _pages

## adding new _posts and removing pre-built _posts
