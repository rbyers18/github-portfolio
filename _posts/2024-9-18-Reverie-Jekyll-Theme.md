excerpt: Getting setup with the Reverie Jekyll theme.

For my first post, I am taking inspiration from Yu Dong's posts and articles on setting up GitHub Pages for the Jekyll theme Reverie. 
Finding very little support for this specific theme, hopefully this can answer some questions for others on the same path :)

After creating a Repository (I used this youtube video to get started) I searched for [free Jekyll themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/free) and selected [Reverie](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/reverie) .



## _config.yml file changes

I'll admit, I called in some help on this one. My limited experience with Git meant I couldn't figure out if I was stuck on something in Github or in the Jekyll files.


You'll also want to update the title, author, etc.

### adding images in the icon

## editing _layouts for Navigation Menu

## adding new _pages and removing pre-built _pages

## adding new _posts and removing pre-built _posts
