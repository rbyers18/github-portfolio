##[The PR FYI with Gene Balk](https://www.weearnmedia.com/episodes/gene-balk)
While reading my local news paper The Seattle Times, I frequently encounter a [column](https://www.seattletimes.com/author/gene-balk-fyi-guy/) by "The FYI Guy" AKA Gene Balk. These stories always come with an analysis from a data source or survey and a graphic or two, and I wanted to know more. This lead me to this podcast where he is interviewed on his process and work, and it answered so many questions I had about how the Times puts its graphics together as well as insights to how to pull relevant stories from data sources.
